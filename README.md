# Bouncing Ball Game

In this repository I'll follow the process of creating a bouncing ball game
In the first commit I already did:

### Basic concepts
* 1. Creating a Ball Object.
* 2. Making the ball move.
* 3. Making the ball change its direction if it hits a wall (edge of the screen).
* 4. Creating 10 balls in random positions with random size and making them bounce.

### User participation
* 1. Creating a paddle and making it follow the pointer (mouse).
* 2. Restore the game to a single ball.
* 3. Checking if the ball touches the paddle then change the ball direction (as if it was a wall).

### Finishing the game
* 1. Creating a Block class and instantiate blocks in the screen.
* 2. If the ball touches a block it dissapears.

### Making it "Juicy"
* 1. Modifying the paddle so if the ball hits on the left side it goes left and viceversa.
